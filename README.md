# Random Number Generator
This is my first project in JavaScript after teaching myself how to use it. The aim of this project is to get used to the basics of JavaScript so that in the future I can have the foundation to undertake more challenging programs. 

The main specifications I would like to set for this program are:

    -The number generated is an integer and between 1 and 100
    -The user has a certain number of guesses to guess the number correctly
    -The user receives feedback after each guess as to whether they were too high or too low
    -The user is notified when they lose or win
    -There is a play again option
